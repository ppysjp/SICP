So I need to be able to use the code from exercise 3. 
I'm going to google how to import from a racket file.
I'm trying to create a joint account. 
I need to take advantage of the stuff from page 233 where we get the account to point 
at the same location. 
The joint account needs to share the same value for it's balance.
But it needs to use the new-password as the message that is passed for the withdrawal
to occur. 
So I think I need to have access to the balance of the original account.
The change that will be required for this is in the original make-account functionn. 
So let's do that... 
So I now have away of accessing the initial value of the joint account.
