So I think that we are going to need a function that has internal statevariable. 
We need a function that if (f 0) and then (f 1) is called then we get 0.
On the other hand if we call (f 1) and then (f 0) we get 1. 
To do this I'm going to have an internal state variable to my function f that is initialised
to a value. 

Cool. I'm not going to care if it is wrong.

We can test this out by assigning the value of whatever is returned by f(x) and then adding.

well what two numbers when added together make 0? 
+ 0 0 makes 0. 
So let's create a function without state that does that...

At the moment I will always get 0 because f is a pure function. So I need to get a none pure function.
To do that I'm going to introduce an internal state varialbe.
