So I need to draw the environment and all of the evaluations that happen for the make-withdraw procedure.
cool. 
So I've set up the question to be able to proceed with it :) 
Now I need to begin drawing the solution...

I think that I have done the building of the object without 
any probem...

The evaluation of thsi procedure is actully quite difficult...

cool so I've setup my environment...

You can basically see how these objects create a lot of repeated code when evaluated if you carefully go through the 
diagrams that I have drawn.
