Ok so for this question I've been asked to create a drawing of the environment structure that is created 
by the recursive and iterative form of the factorial function.

To do this I need ot understand the environment model but these functions don't make use of assignment 
so I don't think I need to worry about that for now.

The thing we are being tested on in this section is on page 240 which tells us how a procedre is applied
using the environment model.

I think that what hte question is trying to teach is that essentially the frames that are generated from the 
recursive and iterative forms will be fundamentamentally different...

I think I can draw the answer...
