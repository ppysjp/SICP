So in the question we are given how to create a withdraw object that explicitly 
has an internal variable. The first thing I'm going to do is to convert this 
make-withdraw into one that doesn't use let but uses lambda. 
The first step on the other hand is to create the lambda so I'm going to do that 
first.
