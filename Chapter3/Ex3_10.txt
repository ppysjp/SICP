So in the question we are given how to create a withdraw object that explicitly 
has an internal variable. The first thing I'm going to do is to convert this 
make-withdraw into one that doesn't use let but uses lambda. 
The first step on the other hand is to create the lambda so I'm going to do that 
first. 

Now that I have created the withdraw object so that it uses the stuff from the book,
I need to create a new withdraw object that uses the lambda form of let...
