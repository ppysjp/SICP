I owe this book and these exercises so much, it has really taught me a lot of techniques for writing code that is modular and pure. 

I am particularly proud of my solution to the 8 queens puzzle as I never thought I would be able to do this mind bending question (Exercise 42).

The great thing about this book is that each exercise builds on the last and so you really do notice your ability to code developing.

The other interesting thing is that when you return to a programming language like C# with a full IDE at your disposal and tests, you find that because you have been coding with your hands behind your back using the esoteric language scheme, you feel all the benefits of the language features that a fully fledged language has to give like C#.
